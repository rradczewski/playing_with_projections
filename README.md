# Playing with projections

See [michelgrootjans/playing_with_projections](https://github.com/michelgrootjans/playing_with_projections/blob/master/README.md) for the original README and initial instructions.

Slides from me are [here](slides.pdf).

## Challenges

 - How many events does a stream have?
 - How many registered players do we have?
 - How many registered players do we have per month?
 - How many players haven't played in a month?
 - What is the most popular quiz?
 - What's the hardest (or easiest) question we have?
 - How many players signed up but never played a game?
 - Which player had the longest winning-streak?
 - Who has won which game?
 - Which quiz makes people so angry that they quit
   their session or never come back at all?

## Solutions

A solution to some projections can be found in [`solution.log`](./solution.log). The implementation is in [`js/`](./js/).
